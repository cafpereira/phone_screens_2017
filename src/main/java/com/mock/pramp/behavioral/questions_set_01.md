# Behavioral Question Set 1

1. Tell me a bit about your professional experience in 2-3 minutes.
    - This question will allow you to get an initial sense of your peer’s experience.
    - Feel free to ask follow-up questions, for instance, can you elaborate a bit more on your experience with [specific technology] or your responsibilities at [company]? You can also use this opportunity to ask the candidate which of their experiences had the greatest impact on them.

2. What are you looking for in your next role?
    - This is an opportunity to get insight into whether a candidate would be a good culture fit for your company. Is the candidate looking for a company of your size? Do their expectations match the role?
    
3. What’s an example of a difficult problem you solved? Be specific about how the problem was diagnosed and your process for approaching it.
    - Owner vs participant: Many candidates will claim they led a big project or created significant impact, but if you dig deeper, you’ll find that the candidate only played a participatory role or was involved in just one facet of the project. As an interviewer, it’s your role to uncover the truth. Follow-up questions asking about who was involved, what the candidate personally did, and how they did it will help you make an informed decision about the candidate’s true impact.
    - Good vs great achievements: Many candidates are good at quantifying their achievements, but you’ll want to know how big of an impact this achievement actually had. Was it a minor success or did it have a significant impact? Were the results due to the candidate’s impact, or would those results have likely occurred without their involvement? You may consider asking follow-up questions here too: try to drill down into the baseline metrics used, such as “What were the projected metrics had you not made this decision?”
    
4. What is your biggest strength and weakness?
    - This question helps you evaluate how self-aware the candidate is about their personal/professional experience. Encourage the candidate to use a specific example to highlight each of their answers. For the growth portion, you should decide whether you’d like the candidate to speak about an area of growth they identified in the past and resolved or a recent growth area and their plans for overcoming it.

5. Tell me about a challenge you’ve recently faced in your role. How did you tackle it, what was the outcome, and what did you learn?
    - This question gives the candidate the opportunity to deep dive into an example of their core competencies (collaboration, communication, attention to detail, tech-savvy, etc). It allows you to get a snapshot of their self-awareness of their skills.
    - An appropriate follow-up question might be “What would you have done differently and why?”
    
6. Tell me about a time when you had to motivate your team to take a particular action.
    - This question is about teamwork and influence. You want to dig into the candidate’s ability to reason through a problem, collaborate with teammates, discuss the tradeoffs of particular actions, and ultimately, show how they were able to bring others on board with their vision.
